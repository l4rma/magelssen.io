                    My name is Lars. I'm an IT consulent mostly working 
                    with backend development. This is my website.

                    This is a project in progress of creating a website from 
                    scratch. What's on this site is not really important,
                    the goal is to have fun creating a full stack website
                    and actually deploy and support it with CI/CD.
